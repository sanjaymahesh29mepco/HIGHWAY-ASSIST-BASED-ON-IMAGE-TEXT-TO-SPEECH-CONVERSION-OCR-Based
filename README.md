# HIGHWAY-ASSIST-BASED-ON-IMAGE-TEXT-TO-SPEECH-CONVERSION-OCR-Based
ABSTRACT:
This project describes an innovative, cost-effective assistive technology 
designed to enhance highway safety and accessibility for both visually impaired users 
and the general public. The solution provides real-time, offline navigation guidance by 
integrating Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text-To-Speech (TTS) modules 
developed within the MATLAB environment. 
The system functions by capturing images of highway signboards, using the 
OCR module to accurately extract the textual information. This extracted text is then 
processed by the TTS module, converting the written information into clear, audible 
speech. This audio output delivers critical navigation instructions and alerts to the user 
without requiring an internet connection. 
By offering an accessible, non-visual interface to essential road information, this 
system effectively assists visually impaired travellers in navigating highways 
independently and safely. Furthermore, it serves as a valuable, supplementary guidance 
tool for all drivers, enhancing situational awareness and contributing to safer travel 
experiences. The solution's reliance on readily available technology and offline 
functionality ensures a practical and reliable approach to modern navigation assistance.
